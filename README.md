# FlappyBirdML
Attempting to teach a Neural Network (built from scratch) to play flappy bird. 

## Introduction
This is (was) my attempt of teaching a neural net I built from scratch in numpy to play the infamous flappy bird, which I also built from scratch in pygame for python,
happy to say it was successful and actually performed better than I thought it would!

## The game
the game is pretty simple, You have a bird that is trying to keep flying while facing the trouble of gravity and obstacles blocking its way, in order to keep flying you need to jump just at the right pace so that you remain in air and pass through the opening of the obstacle. the game is score based and is never ending.
